# Projects
Some of the projects that i have made during my time as a Computer Engineer student. 
Some of the projects are missing some features but they do the job. 
## Project 1 "Library Assistant"
I have used java coding language to build a windows app that allows you to read and store books to a database in java. i used javafx for GUI.
